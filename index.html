    <h1>Poetry by KRS1</h1>
    <p>Class is session so you should stop guessing if this is script or a written down memo, see I am a professional, this is not a demo in fact call it a visual picture, something like a poetic and rhythm like mixture. Listen, I'm not dissing but there's something that you missing, maybe you should wish for beats with plenty base, and lyrics set in haste, if it's meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest. </p>
